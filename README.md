# Creative-Coding-Final
This is a portfolio showcasing my best work in my creative coding class.


Before my introduction To Creative Coding 302, I had no prior experince to coding. This past semester has been a compleletly new scenery in art for me. I started out being terrified of a cartigional plane and it took me at least thirty minutes each to guess the correct coridinates. I have advanced to under a minute for finding the correct placement. I have learned how to create works of art through code, and implement it into different styles. I have used grids with nested for Loops, 3d rendering with WEGBL, animiated story telling with gifs, potery and literature with bindery , to create my best work.
